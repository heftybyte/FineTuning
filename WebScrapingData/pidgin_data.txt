How YouTube, Meta copyright and monetisation policies dey affect creators
On Tuesday, 13 August YouTube strike di music video of one Nigerian song wey dem dey call Ogechi ova copyright claim.
Dem bin drop di video for di remix of di Ogechi song wey Grammy nominee, Davido follow BoyPee, Hyce and Brown Joel sing on 18 July for YouTube.
But now if you click di link for di video wey BoyPee post, di message wey dey pop up na say, "Dis video no longer dey available sake of copyright claim by King Lion official".
But e no mean say di video no dey at all for YouTube. Quick search of di video show say di video still dey online but for di channel wey dem dey call Maravha Shaka get am for dia page.
Dis page also get music videos from all ova Africa including music from Tanzanian musicians, Diamond Platnumz.
E dey strange but also understandable wen you tink am say for di beginning of YouTube for Nigeria, di pipo wey bin dey upload music videos on di platform na music TV stations and programs and na dem still get dat kain music for dia platform.
Dis no go be di first time wey YouTube dey take down music videos around di world.
But na for different reasons, like violence and so on.
For May 2018, YouTube bin take down ova half of di violent music videos wey di United Kingdom senior police oga bin ask dem to comot.
Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick bin blame some of di videos say na dem ginger di rise of murders and violent crimes for London and out of evri song wey dey na drill music she pick. 
At di time, YouTube bin don tok say dem don remove ova 30 videos.
Dis mata of demonetisation of content and copyright issues don comot from different social media platforms dem.
Last month, di tok-tok about monetisation of pesin content come afta comedian Brain Jotter popularise di 80s south-eastern Nigeria hit song Gwo Gwo Gwo Ngwo, wey 90-year-old Mike Ejeagha bin release, wit a viral dance step.
Brain Jotter, wey im real name na Chukwuebuka Emmanuel Amuzi, explain say di copyright of music for social media platform dey strict and any content wey pesin make wit anoda pesin music go receive strike and dis social media go carry di revenue for di content give di creator of di music.
E tok say, "You no fit monetise anoda pesin song becos dis platforms get tools to strike you for copyright violation.
"If I post am for YouTube, di platform go strike am for copyright and carry revenue give Ejeagha, di same tin wit Facebook. Di videos don also help to increase di number of streams well-well for music streaming platforms and e no get how I wan put di song for dis platforms so evritin dey go to Ejeagha hand."
So wetin fit make dem comot pesin music video from dia own YouTube page? 
Well, Intellectual Property lawyer, Kira Green, follow BBC News Pidgin tok say e no suppose dey possible say dat kain tin go happun.
She say, "Dat no suppose happun, maybe na mistake from YouTube becos to ask for takedown of content, you gatz submit evidence for di form wey you dey fill say di content na your own and no belong to anoda pesin."
Madam Green add say, "for takedown requests, you gatz swear on penalty of perjury say you own di copyright of di content and all di details you bin write for di [take down] form dey true, so if pesin claim copyright falsely dem dey likely to face di penalty of perjury becos dem no own di copyright of di tin dem dey try take down."
Even wit di moni share, Nigerian content space don dey grow in di kain way wey smaller creators dey depend on bigger brands like bloggers to repost dia content to make dem blow.
Dis na for social media pages like Facebook and Instagram wey allow monetisation of Nigerian and Ghanaian content for July.
However, content creators fit don find way to side step dat plalava, especially for Instagram, by just including dis big pages wey dem dey hope say go feature dem for dia platforms for dia list of contributors.
Dis mata of copyright takedowns don dey affect content creators too.
Di AMVCA 2023 award winner for di Best Social Media Content Creator, Elozonam Ogbolu don face copyright strikes, but e say e no gree contest am sake of say e go clash wit wen e suppose post am.
E say, "E happun wit My Name Is Zozo (current content series for im channel) two times. But I no dispute am. I just change di track. Dis na as e for take too long to dispute di claim and I no go fit get ansa bifor di episode suppose comot".
Ms Green, however tok say e no suppose to take too long to dispute copyright claim if you get evidence.
She add say while takedowns dey normally happun within a day, e go fit take pass up to 10 days to put am back.
Di mata around music for content work serious sotay even YouTube don arrange library of content free music wey pipo fit use.
But how dis platforms dey find out say some kain content no be for di pesin wey post am? YouTube dey use different means, either pesin tell dem say na my content be dis or e get dis tin wey dem dey call Content ID wey dey work to arrest dat content immediately.
Di second one na copyright removal requests wey copyright owner find dia content wey dey copyright protected and submit di request wey dem dey also call takedown notice. Na legal request to remove content from YouTube sake of alleged copyright infringement.
But if di takedown notice no dey fair and YouTube actually take di content down, Kira Green say "If pesin do a take down notice for anoda pesin video and dem actually comot am, di pesin fit do wetin dem dey call counter-notification to prove say true-true, dis content na my own. Dis na my evidence, YouTube go look am and dem fit reinstate di video."
For Meta, di way dem dey run tins too dey far off.
BBC News Pidgin don reach out to Hyce management to get wetin be di reason of di copyright claim but neva get response.
However, di Ogechi remix music video don come back online afta one day of di copyright claim palava.

Di death of Nollywood actor Junior Pope dis week don raise questions on wetin to do if pesin drown.
Junior Pope wey im real name na Obumneme Odonwodo and some crew members die afta dia boat capsize for River Niger Anambra state.
For Nigeria, river accident dey common, so if dis kain tin happun, you know wetin to do?
We go share some tips wit you, wey fit help save pesin wey drown for water.
Di first, and most important advice be say, no put yourself for danger! Use anytin you fit to bring di pesin wey dey drown out of water, but no put your own safety at risk � you no go fit help dem if you yourself dey in trouble.
If you manage comot dem for water, den you must act very fast to help dem get oxygen to dia brain and organs. Di biggest killer for cases of drowning na lack of oxygen for di body, and by di time you comot pesin from water, dat na di major tin to deal wit. Dat na why sabi pipo advice rescue breaths first dat one na to use your mouth blow air to di pesin wey drown mouth  before you start to do chest compressions.
If you dey on your own, shout for help but no waste time to move di pesin to lifesaving techniques. If  someone else dey wit you, make phone call  for help immediately as you dey do dis tins:-
Check if dem dey breathe by leaning ova dem and placing your cheek near dia mouth.
LOOK dia chest to see if dia chest dey rise and fall, FEEL for breath for your cheek and LISTEN for breathing sounds. If no sign of breath den you suppose give dem �
Each breath you dey give dem suppose last 1 second, and make sure you take deep breath yourself in between each one. These breaths go get valuable oxygen for dia lungs, wey particularly dey important for drowned casualty. Afta you don give 5 rescue breaths try�
If you dey on your own, once you finish to do five rescue breaths and one minute of CPR you fit take time to call di emergency services. Hopefully you go don help di drown victim get some oxygen go dia brain. But as soon as don call for help, den continue:
30 chest compressions followed by 2 rescue breaths ova and ova again until dem start to breath normally or help arrives (if una dey two makr una take turns).
If di pesin wey drown don start to  breathe normally again before help come, den roll dem into di �recovery position�, lie dem for dia side, wit dia top leg and arm bend dem up, and tilt dia head slightly back to help keep dia airway open. If you get any spare cloth to help keep dem warm, den use am cover dem , dey tok to dem  to reassure dem say help dey come.
Most victims of drowning fit no suffer from cardiac arrest, wey fit dey helped by di use of  one machine wey dem dey call defibrillator, although if you dey somewhere wia one dey available, den you fit try am. Dry di skin wey you dey put di defibrillator pads to as much as possible, but you no need to worry about problems or extra hazards from using di defibrillator for wet conditions. E dey more important, however, to help get oxygen around di body, so certainly give rescue breaths and CPR first.

Dem bin book Marian Meanwell on di Majestic - one White Star Line ship. But e no sail, so ontop di card, dem cross Majestic out and her passage show say dem transfer her go di Titanic and she become one of di 1,500 pipo wey lose dia lives.
�To fit tell her story and get dis objects dey really important,� Tomasina tok.
�Otherwise, she just be anoda name for di list.�
Perfume wey still get strong scent
Dem also bring items wey belong to survivors from under di deep sea.
Tomasina open one plastic container and one sweet smell fill di air. �E dey very powerful,� she disclose.
Inside na tiny bottles of perfume. Dem dey sealed, but pipo fit smell dia strong aroma, even afta decades on di seafloor.
�E get one perfume salesman on board and e get ova 90 of dis little perfume bottles,� Tomasina explain.
Im name na Adolphe Saalfeld, e bin dey travel as a second-class passenger.
Saalfeld na one of di 700 pipo wey survive. But women and children na di priority during di evacuation, some men wey make am off di ship, di mata continue to trouble dem.
�E don die by di time we find dis,�Tomasina tok. �But na my understanding say e bin live wit small guilt - survivor guilt.�
A champagne lifestyle
Also for di collection, na one champagne bottle � e complete wit champagne inside and a cork for di top.
�Small water fit don enta through di cork as e compress and equalise di pressure. And den, e just siddon for di bottom of di ocean,� Tomasina tok.
Wen di Titanic sink for 1912, afta e hit one iceberg, di ship bin divide and di contents bin spill out, and e create one large debris field.
�Plenty bottles dey for di ocean floor and plenty stock pots and kitchen pots too, becos di Titanic actually break up for around one of di kitchens,� Tomasina tok.
Thousands of bottles of champagne bin dey on board. Di owner of di ship bin want make im first-class passengers experience di ultimate luxury, wit extravagant surroundings and di finest food and drink.
�E be like floating palace and Titanic suppose be di most luxurious liner,� Tomasina tok.
�So make champagne dey, make gym dey, make e get all dis amenities and dis great things for di passengers, na something wey bin dey really important to dem.�
Di Titanic rivets
Di Titanic bin dey on her maiden voyage, she bin dey travel for di first time from Southampton go di US, wen she hit di iceberg.
Di ship bin get advanced safety features of dat time and e dem bin famously tok say e dey unsinkable.
Tomasina show us some of di ship rivets - metal pins - wey include pins, nails, screws, fasteners, bolts, wey hold di ship thick steel plates togeda. 
Di rivets wey we see go pass more dan three million.
�Wen Titanic sank, one theory bin dey go round say, di builders bin dey use  substandard materials, and maybe na wetin make am sink faster be dat,� Tomasina explain.
Dem bin test some of dis rivets to see if dem contain any impurities.
�High concentrations of slag bin dey dis ones, wey be one glass-like material wey dey make dem dey maybe a little bit more hard for di cold,� she tok.
Tomasina say plenty tins still dey to learn about how exactly di ship take sink.
�We dey help look into di theories, so as to dey able contribute to di science and di story behind am, na something wey we dey very happy to do.�
Di class divide
Life on board dey different for di social classes - even down to di cups and plates dem dey drink and eat from.
One white third-class mug dey simple and durable, and e get bright red White Star logo.
Second-class plate get one beautiful blue floral decoration and e look more finer.
But first-class dinner plate dey made of more delicate china. E get gold trim and, under di light, you fit catch a glimpse of one elegant garland pattern.
Dem dey give wealthy first-class passengers, silver service for dia meals - but for third class, na different story.
�Third-class passengers probably for don handle di china by themselves � Dem do di plates to dey more stable and pipo fit handle am anyhow pass di oda china,� Tomasina explain.
RMS Titanic Inc na di only company wey dem legally allow to recover items from di site � na one US court grant dem dis right for 1994.
But dem get to do am under strict conditions - di items must always remain togeda, so dem no fit sell dem off separately, and dem get to look afta dem well-well.
Until now, all di artefacts dem don collect na from di debris field. But recently, di firm bin start one controversy say dem wan retrieve one object from di ship itself - di Marconi radio equipment wey transmit di Titanic distress calls on di night of di sinking.
Some believe say di wreck na grave site and make dem leave am alone.
�Titanic na something wey we wan respect,� Tomasina reply.
�We wan make sure say we dey preserve di memory, becos no be everybody fit go wia Titanic dey, and we wan dey able to bring dat to di public.�
More room soon fit dey needed on di shelves of dis secret warehouse.
For di company latest expedition go di site, dem take millions of fotos of wetin remain of di Titanic to create a detailed 3D scan.
Dem also survey di current condition of di Marconi radio room, di team also dey identify objects for di debris field dem go like retrieve in future dives.
Who sabi wetin dem go find and which kain new tori each item fit reveal about di ill-fated Titanic plus her passengers.
